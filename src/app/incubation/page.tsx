          As a founder, the hardest step is to get started. beFUNDR is designed
          to make this first step as easy as possible.

        <p>
          By merging a professional and tailored guidance with a community
          layer, beFUNDR redefines the incubation code.

          After a pre-selection by our partners, the final say goes to the
          community. <br />
          The selection process is coupled with a kickstart funding round:
          projects that sell the most early adopter NFTs earn their place in the
          upcoming incubation batch. A minimum of $50k sale is also required to
          insure a good incubation.

          We are convinced that the funding landscape evolving fast, driven by
          aim of fairness and transaparency.
        </p>
        <p>
          At beFUNDR, we fully embrace this vision! <br />
          Once again, decentralization is the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          We&apos;re have built a framework where VCs and retail investors can
          truly co-exist: No backdoors deals, no privileges for big players over
          smaller investors. Just a fair way to be early.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the kickstart NFT sale, VCs can contribute during incubation.
          Then comes the fully public, sequenced token sale:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-decimal list-inside">
          <li>Kickstart NFT holders (via airdrop)</li>
          <li>OG Solana communities</li>
          <li>General public</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Project valuation evolves naturally: <br />
          First through Kickstart NFT sales, then through strategic VC deals
          during incubation. <br />
          Finally, the public sale follows a light bonding curve, with part of
          the raised funds used to supply DEX liquidity pools.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fundraising can happen through the project&apos;s native token (when
          it makes sense) or via tokenized equity, depending on the nature of
          the project.
