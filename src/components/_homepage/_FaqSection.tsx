        <FaqQuestionCard question="How does funding work on beFUNDR?">
          <p>
            Funding on beFUNDR happens in two key phases. First, selected
            projects receive up to <strong>$100k in kickstart funding</strong>,
            sourced from early adopters during an NFT sale. This gives builders
            the runway to prototype and engage their community.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then comes the <strong>incubation phase</strong>, supported by our
            Community Skills Hub â€” a curated network of mentors and
            contributors. After proving traction, projects move into a{" "}
            <strong>token or tokenized-equity sale</strong> conducted in 3
            rounds: first to NFT holders, then to OG communities, and finally to
            the public.
          </p>
