        <p>
          Our project addresses a common pain point in the Web3 space: lack of
          accessible, user-friendly tools for newcomers. By simplifying
          interactions and reducing friction, we aim to onboard the next wave of
          users and contributors to the decentralized ecosystem.

      <FaqQuestionCard question="How will the funds be used after the kickstart phase?">
        <p>
          The initial funds will be allocated to product development, smart
          contract audits, community building, and launching key features.
          Transparency is core to our mission â€” a detailed funding roadmap will
          be published and regularly updated.
